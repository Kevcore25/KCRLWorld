# KCRLWorld
KCRLWorld (also known as RLWorld or RLW) is a Minecraft datapack that changes the game to a more modded experience.
RLWorld is designed to not require any other modded experience other than the gameplay itself. Therefore, no resource pack or mods are needed to use it.

## Documentation / Wiki
There is no wiki, but there is an official documentation for RLWorld6 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tosI571KSLzzSuAdpiP7V-SgYxhWcg6p0_l6jIg4v4/edit). However, the documentation is not planned to be updated anytime in the future.

## Installing
1. Select the version you want to download by selecting the branch (main is the latest).
2. Download the files as a ZIP, which should contain the folder "data" inside.
3. Drag or copy the ZIP file into a world's datapack folder.
4. As an operator, run `/function cmd:load`. You may need to enable the datapack using the `/datapack enable` command.
